Fill in the form and choose a payment method. \u003cbr\u003eNote about payment methods: Some payment methods are considered high-risk. Cryptocurrency transactions are completely irreversible. Once you sell your cryptocurrency it won't be possible for you to recover them, even if the buyer's payment is reversed. We recommend you choose a low risk payment method and to favour experienced users with a large amount of previous trades and postivie reviews.\u003cbr\u003eStep 3\u003cbr\u003ePick one advertisement from the list where the trader has a good reputation score and a high amount of completed trades. You can click the sell button to view more information about an advertisement.\u003cbr\u003eStep 4\u003cbr\u003eAfter you press the Sell button, you'll see more information about the advertisement, including the terms of the trade.

After you have given the seller the payment information, the buyer will pay for the cryptocurrency and confirm it has been sent. \u003cbr\u003ePlease make sure that you have received the money into your account before releasing the cryptocurrency. Never release the cryptocurrency before you have received the payment. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, once you send the cryptocurrency to the buyer there is no way to get them back, even if the buyers payment doesn't show up. \u003cbr\u003eOnce you have confirmed that the payment has been made, you can select the 'Release' cryptocurrency button.

That's why it is important to never release the cryptocurrency from the escrow until you receive the payment. Even if they are a regular buyer or someone you know, it can be risky as once the cryptocurrency has been released from the escrow since there is no way for you to recover the assets. \u003cbr\u003eWith reversible payments, scammers will attempt to pay using stolen credentials or purchase proof. You can require the buyer to have their identity verified on their CoinCola account, and then check if the user's real name matches the name of the payment account to avoid these scams. \u003cbr\u003eIf you ever encounter a suspicious user, you can always open a dispute for the trade and the CoinCola support team will help to resolve the situation.\u003cbr\u003e","order_faq_sell_content_3":"Fraudulent buyers are often in a hurry.

Our real customers always have patience. \u003cbr\u003eFraudulent buyers often suggest doing all or a part of the transaction outside the escrow and then do not complete their part of the transaction. \u003cbr\u003eBe careful about photoshopped payment evidence, don't release cryptocurrency until you have confirmed that you have received the money. You are not obliged to release a trade until you can verify that you have received the buyer's payment. \u003cbr\u003eDon't open any links that your trading partner is sending to you. If you must, use different browser than the one you are usually using. \u003cbr\u003eDon't visit websites other than CoinCola with the same browser that you're using to trade. Use a different browser to navigate on other websites. \u003cbr\u003eBookmark CoinCola in your browser and always use the bookmark when visiting the website.
